      <h2>📌 What is Linear Algebra?</h2>
      <p><strong>Linear Algebra</strong> is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.</p>
      <p>It is fundamental in areas such as physics, engineering, computer graphics, machine learning, and more.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔢 Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalar:</strong> A single number (e.g., 3, -1, 0.5)</li>
        <li><strong>Vector:</strong> An ordered list of numbers, often represented as a column or row (e.g., [2, 5] or ⎡2⎤ ⎣5⎦)</li>
        <li><strong>Matrix:</strong> A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧮 Matrix Operations</h2>

      <h3>Addition & Subtraction</h3>
      <p>You can add or subtract matrices of the same size by adding/subtracting corresponding elements.</p>

      <h3>Scalar Multiplication</h3>
      <p>Multiply every element in the matrix by a scalar value.</p>

      <h3>Matrix Multiplication</h3>
      <p>Multiply rows of the first matrix by columns of the second. Only possible if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second.</p>

      <h3>Transpose</h3>
      <p>Switch rows and columns. If A is a 2×3 matrix, then Aᵗ is 3×2.</p>

      <h3>Determinant</h3>
      <p>Only defined for square matrices. The determinant gives useful properties like invertibility.</p>

      <h3>Inverse</h3>
      <p>The matrix A⁻¹ is the inverse of A if A × A⁻¹ = I (identity matrix). Only invertible if determinant ≠ 0.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>📐 Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
      <p>A system of linear equations is a set of equations like:</p>
      <pre><code>
2x + 3y = 5
4x -  y = 1
      </code></pre>
      <p>Can be solved using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Substitution</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Elimination</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Matrix methods</strong> (e.g., Gaussian elimination, inverse matrices)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📊 Vector Spaces</h2>
      <p>A <strong>vector space</strong> is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied (scaled) by numbers (scalars).</p>
      <p>To be a vector space, the set must satisfy 10 specific rules (like associativity, commutativity, zero vector, etc.).</p>
      <p>Examples of vector spaces: ℝ², ℝ³, or any space where linear operations make sense.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📏 Linear Independence</h2>
      <p>Vectors are <strong>linearly independent</strong> if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.</p>
      <p>If they are dependent, it means at least one vector is redundant in describing the space.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📐 Basis and Dimension</h2>
      <p>A <strong>basis</strong> is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space.</p>
      <p>The <strong>dimension</strong> is the number of vectors in the basis.</p>
      <p>Example: ℝ² has a dimension of 2, and a common basis is [1,0] and [0,1]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>↔️ Linear Transformations</h2>
      <p>A <strong>linear transformation</strong> is a function between vector spaces that preserves addition and scalar multiplication.</p>
      <p>They can be represented by matrices: If T is a transformation, then T(x) = A·x where A is a matrix.</p>
      <p>Applications include computer graphics (rotation, scaling, etc.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h2>
      <p>For a matrix A, if A·v = λ·v for a vector v ≠ 0, then:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>λ is an <strong>eigenvalue</strong></li>
        <li>v is an <strong>eigenvector</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are powerful tools used in fields like physics, machine learning (PCA), and quantum mechanics.</p>
    </section>
