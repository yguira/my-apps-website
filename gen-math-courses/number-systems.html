      <h2>📌 What is the Number System?</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Number System</strong> is a way to classify, represent, and operate with numbers. It forms the foundation of all mathematical operations and concepts.</p>
      <p>Different types of numbers serve different purposes, from simple counting to solving complex equations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧱 Types of Numbers</h2>

      <h3>1. Natural Numbers (ℕ)</h3>
      <p>Also known as counting numbers. These are the numbers starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.</p>
      <p><strong>Notation:</strong> ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}</p>

      <h3>2. Whole Numbers</h3>
      <p>Natural numbers plus 0.</p>
      <p><strong>Notation:</strong> {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</p>

      <h3>3. Integers (ℤ)</h3>
      <p>Includes all positive and negative whole numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Notation:</strong> ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</p>

      <h3>4. Rational Numbers (ℚ)</h3>
      <p>Any number that can be written as a fraction of two integers (a/b where b ≠ 0).</p>
      <p>Includes integers, terminating decimals, and repeating decimals.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> 1/2, -3/4, 0.75, 2, -1</p>

      <h3>5. Irrational Numbers</h3>
      <p>Numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> √2, π, e</p>

      <h3>6. Real Numbers (ℝ)</h3>
      <p>All rational and irrational numbers together form the real numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Includes:</strong> All numbers that can be placed on a number line.</p>

      <h3>7. Imaginary Numbers</h3>
      <p>Numbers that are multiples of the square root of -1, denoted as i.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> i, 2i, -5i</p>

      <h3>8. Complex Numbers (ℂ)</h3>
      <p>Numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part.</p>
      <p><strong>Form:</strong> a + bi where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> 3 + 4i, -1 + 0i (which is just -1)</p>

      <h2>📏 Properties of the Number System</h2>

      <h3>1. Closure Property</h3>
      <p>The result of an operation (like addition or multiplication) on numbers in a set is also in that set.</p>
      <p>Example: Integers are closed under addition.</p>

      <h3>2. Commutative Property</h3>
      <p>a + b = b + a and a × b = b × a</p>

      <h3>3. Associative Property</h3>
      <p>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)</p>

      <h3>4. Distributive Property</h3>
      <p>a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c</p>

      <h3>5. Identity Elements</h3>
      <p>Additive identity: 0 → a + 0 = a</p>
      <p>Multiplicative identity: 1 → a × 1 = a</p>

      <h3>6. Inverse Elements</h3>
      <p>Additive inverse: a + (-a) = 0</p>
      <p>Multiplicative inverse: a × (1/a) = 1, for a ≠ 0</p>

      <h2>📊 Comparing and Ordering Numbers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a number line to compare values visually</li>
        <li>Negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers</li>
        <li>Fractions and decimals can be converted to compare</li>
        <li>Irrational numbers like √2 can be approximated for comparison</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔢 Number Bases</h2>
      <p>The decimal system (base 10) is most common, but other systems include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary (base 2):</strong> Used in computers (0 and 1 only)</li>
        <li><strong>Octal (base 8)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hexadecimal (base 16):</strong> Used in computing (0-9 and A-F)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🧠 Prime Numbers</h2>
      <p>A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself.</p>
      <p>Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17...</p>
      <p>Used in cryptography, number theory, and factoring.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🎯 Perfect, Composite, and Even/Odd Numbers</h2>

      <h3>Composite Numbers</h3>
      <p>Have more than two factors. Example: 4, 6, 8, 9</p>

      <h3>Perfect Numbers</h3>
      <p>Equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Example: 6 → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6</p>

      <h3>Even Numbers</h3>
      <p>Divisible by 2</p>

      <h3>Odd Numbers</h3>
      <p>Not divisible by 2</p>
